### Algorithm for the `J03_HelloApp` Program üíª

This algorithm outlines the program's steps, including the intended and unintended behavior that leads to the error.

1.  **Start Program:** Begin execution at the `main` method.
2.  **Display Information:** Print a blank line, the current JDK version, and a "Hello, World\!" message with a number to the console.
3.  **Declare Variable:** Create a variable named `frame` of type `J04_Frame` and initialize it to `null`.
4.  **Attempt Object Creation:** Try to create a new `J04_Frame` object.
5.  **Handle Exception:** If any exception occurs during the creation of the `J04_Frame` object, catch it and print its stack trace. **Crucially, if an exception is caught, the `frame` variable will remain `null`.**
6.  **Show Window (Error Point):** Attempt to call the `setVisible(true)` method on the `frame` variable.
7.  **Crash:** Since the `frame` variable is `null` (because of the failed object creation), the program throws a **`NullPointerException`** and stops executing.

### Pseudocode for the `J03_HelloApp` Program ‚úçÔ∏è

This pseudocode translates the logic, including the error-prone parts, into a high-level, human-readable format.

```
BEGIN
  CLASS J03_HelloApp
    METHOD main(args: ARRAY OF STRING)
      PRINT new line
      PRINT "Running on JDK " + Runtime.version()
      SET number TO 42
      PRINT "Hello, World! The answer is " + number

      DECLARE variable 'frame' of type J04_Frame
      SET frame TO null

      TRY
        SET frame TO new J04_Frame()
      CATCH Exception 'e'
        PRINT the stack trace of 'e'
      END TRY
      
      // The next line causes an error if the 'frame' variable is null
      CALL setVisible(true) ON frame
    END METHOD
  END CLASS
END
