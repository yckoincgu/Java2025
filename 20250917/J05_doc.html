Algorithm for J05_App
This algorithm describes the logical steps the program follows, focusing on the creation and interaction with objects.

Start: The program begins execution at the main method.

Object Creation:

Create a new instance of the J05_App class, named app1, initializing its name to "iPhone" and model to 14.

Create a second instance of the J05_App class, named app2, initializing its name to "SamSung Galaxy" and model to 7.

Property Modification:

Change the model property of the app1 object to 5.

Method Calls:

Call the displayInfo() method on the app1 object. This will print the values of its name and model properties to the console.

Call the displayInfo() method on the app2 object. This will print the values of its name and model properties to the console.

End: The program completes its execution.

Pseudocode for J05_App ✍️
This pseudocode translates the program's structure into a high-level, human-readable format, highlighting the class definition and the main execution flow.

BEGIN
  CLASS J05_App
    // Declare instance variables
    DECLARE name AS STRING
    DECLARE model AS INTEGER

    // Define the constructor
    METHOD J05_App(name_param: STRING, model_param: INTEGER)
      SET this.name TO name_param
      SET this.model TO model_param
    END METHOD

    // Define a method to get a greeting
    METHOD getGreeting() RETURNS STRING
      RETURN "Hello World!"
    END METHOD

    // Define a method to display info
    METHOD displayInfo()
      PRINT "Name: " + this.name
      PRINT "Model: " + this.model
    END METHOD

    // Main execution method
    METHOD main(args: ARRAY OF STRING)
      // Create two objects
      CREATE app1 AS NEW J05_App WITH name="iPhone", model=14
      CREATE app2 AS NEW J05_App WITH name="SamSung Galaxy", model=7

      // Modify a property
      SET app1.model TO 5

      // Call methods on the objects
      CALL displayInfo() ON app1
      CALL displayInfo() ON app2
    END METHOD
  END CLASS
