Algorithm for the AWT Program
This algorithm breaks down the program's logic into a series of logical steps, independent of any specific programming language. It focuses on the creation of a window and the subsequent display of a message within it.

Start Program: The program begins execution at its entry point.

Display System Info: Print messages to the console indicating the current Java Development Kit (JDK) version and a general "Hello, World!" message with a number.

Create a Window: Instantiate a new HelloFrame object, which is a specialized type of window (Frame).

Set the title of the window to "Hello, AWT!".

Set the size of the window to 400x400 pixels.

Handle Window Closing: Add a mechanism to the window so that when the user attempts to close it (e.g., by clicking the "X" button), the program will exit gracefully.

Display the Window: Make the newly created window visible on the screen.

Draw Content: The AWT system automatically handles the redrawing of the window. When this occurs, the program will draw the text "Hello, AWT!" at a specific coordinate (150, 150) on the window's surface.

End Program: The program terminates only when the window is closed by the user.

Pseudocode for the AWT Program
This pseudocode uses a high-level, human-readable format to represent the structure and flow of the Java program.

BEGIN
  CLASS HelloFrame INHERITS FROM Frame
    // Constructor for the window
    METHOD HelloFrame(title: STRING)
      CALL parent constructor WITH title
      SET size TO 400x400
      
      // Add a listener to handle window events
      ADD window listener
        WHEN window is closing
          EXIT program
        END WHEN
      END ADD
    END METHOD

    // Method for drawing on the window
    METHOD paint(graphics: Graphics)
      DRAW string "Hello, AWT!" at position (150, 150) using graphics object
    END METHOD
  END CLASS

  // Main application class
  CLASS J02_HelloApp
    // Main method to start the program
    METHOD main(args: ARRAY OF STRING)
      PRINT new line
      PRINT "Running on JDK " + version
      SET number TO 42
      PRINT "Hello, World! The answer is " + number

      // Create an instance of our custom window
      CREATE new HelloFrame object
      SET its title to "Hello, AWT!"
      
      // Make the window visible
      SET its visibility to TRUE
    END METHOD
  END CLASS
END
